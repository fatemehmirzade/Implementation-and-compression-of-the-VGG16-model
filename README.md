# Implementation-and-compression-of-the-VGG16-model
The implemented neural network in this study utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset. The neural network architecture employed is based on the VGG16 model. Following the implementation, the model is trained using a set of predefined hyperparameters, notably including the learning rate, initially set at 0.001 and later increased to 0.01.
To mitigate the risk of overfitting, a data augmentation strategy is employed, involving operations such as image flipping and cropping. Additionally, a portion of 10% of the training data is reserved for validation purposes.
Training of the model proceeds until the achieved accuracy on evaluation data reaches approximately 90%. Subsequently, error and accuracy metrics are thoroughly examined, and corresponding visualization plots are generated, illustrating the model's high accuracy.
Moreover, the Singular Information (SI) center values for the network layers are computed for both training and testing datasets, and graphical representations depicting the variations of these values for each dataset are provided.
The principal aim underlying the implementation of this neural network is to delve into the realm of neural network compression. Specifically, a neural network architecture of the 16VGG model type is instantiated, followed by training with specified hyperparameters.
The compression of neural networks stands as a crucial technique for optimizing model performance, as it facilitates a reduction in the parameter count, thereby augmenting the speed of both training and inference phases. This compression approach concurrently alleviates the memory requirements.
Consequently, by executing the provided code and training the neural network model, a concerted effort is made towards bolstering the efficiency and applicability of neural networks through the adoption of compression and optimization methodologies.
